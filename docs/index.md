The purpose of this tutorial are for programmers to gain the ability to understand how to implement and use different data structures and algorithms to solve non-trivial problems.

Since the purpose is to understand how to use these techniques, I will be using Python3.6+ due to its intuitiveness and readability.
### What are Data Structures?

### What are Algorithms?

### Asymptotic Analysis

#### Time Complexity

#### Space Complexity
