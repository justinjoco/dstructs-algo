The purpose of this tutorial are for programmers to gain the ability to understand how to implement and use different data structures and algorithms to solve non-trivial problems.

### What are Data Structures?
Data structures store information in various ways.

### What are Algorithms?
These are step-by-step procedures that a program will take, akin to someone following a food recipe.
### Asymptotic Analysis
This is the study of an algorithm to determine how quickly it will execute given various inputs.

#### Time Complexity
In layman's terms, this describes how long it will take for a computer to execute your program.
#### Space Complexity
This describes how much extra memory the computer will need to execute your program.
